cmmoore@colby.edu,BI382,heavy use,None of the above,"Data visualization, Statistical modeling, Domain specific application",Yes,Colby's RStudio server,"I think that students need more training in fundamentals, like data types and data structures. Once they understand those ideas, then they will be empowered to learn *so much more* in R.

I would also like to discuss explicit specification of arguments in functions. I am discovering that students place objects inside functions and just expect magic to happen or they learn the argument order and don't ever specify them too often. I think that we should teach students to specify their arguments because: (1) it can help reveal when the operation is failing, (2) it's more human readable, and (3) it will help their future selves when they reference their code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
